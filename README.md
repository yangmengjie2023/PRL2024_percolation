# Percolation-Induced PT Symmetry Breaking

This repository contains some visual presenting related to our study of **percolation-induced parity-time (PT) symmetry breaking**, published in *Physical Review Letters* https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.133.136602.

We investigate how disorder introduced by **percolation** (random deletion of lattice sites or bonds) fundamentally alters the PT symmetry and non-Hermitian phase transitions in quantum and classical systems.

## Scientific Context

**PT symmetry** allows certain non-Hermitian Hamiltonians to exhibit entirely real eigenvalue spectra up to a critical point. Traditional studies assume:
- Clean, highly symmetric systems.
- Uniform, controlled non-Hermitian perturbations.

**Our work challenges these assumptions** by demonstrating that random geometric disorder (via percolation) can **induce or suppress** PT symmetry breaking **without tuning external parameters**.

In short: **geometry alone** can drive a phase transition.

> This questions the widespread belief that PT breaking is purely a dynamical or spectral instability â€” the underlying lattice topology plays a nontrivial, sometimes dominant, role.
